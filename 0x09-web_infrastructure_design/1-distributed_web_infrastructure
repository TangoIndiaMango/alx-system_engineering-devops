What is the difference between the primary node and the replica node in regard to the application.

One of the main differences between the primary node and the replica node, regarding the application, is that the primary database is regarded as the authoritative source, while the replica database is synchronized to it. The primary node serves as the keeper of information, here the “real” data is kept, then writing only happens here. On the other hand, reading only occurs in the replica or slave node. This architecture purpose is due to safeguard site reliability. In case a site receives a lot of traffic, a replica node prevents overloading of the master node with reading and writing requests. This eases the load of the entire system preventing it to collapse (Theodorus, 2020).
